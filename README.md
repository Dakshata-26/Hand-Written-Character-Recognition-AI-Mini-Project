# Hand-Written-Character-Recognition-AI-Mini-Project

# ABSTRACT 
In todays’ world advancement in sophisticated scientific techniques is pushing further the limits of human outreach in various fields of technology. One such field is the field of character recognition commonly known as HCR (Handwritten Character Recognition). 
Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters, different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages and scripts. 
This project, ‘Handwritten Character Recognition’ is a software algorithm project to recognize any hand written character that is, English alphabets from A-Z, efficiently on computer with input is either an old optical image or currently provided through touch input, mouse or pen.
